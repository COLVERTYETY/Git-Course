# Some setup to do before starting up Git Course

### 1. Install Git 

- For Windows :  [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- For MacOS      :   [Git for Mac Os](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

For Linux :
```
#add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
#apt update; apt install git
```
### 2. Create Github Account

- [Github](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)

### 3. Optional : Install Git Client and Vs Code

There are many clients for git I recommend **SourceTree** and **GitKraken** for my part. (A little preference for *Gitkraken*  because with the Pole Leonard de Vinci we have the pro version for free.
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download)
- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

I also strongly recommend to install vs code for your future engineering career :) 
[VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

This is my first course please be indulgent and enjoy Git :)
